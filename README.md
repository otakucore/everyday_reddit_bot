# everyday_reddit_bot
A bot to address the rampant misuse of "everyday" on Reddit by identifying errors and offering polite corrections.

The bot will search for new comments and submissions containing the word "everyday" and use the language_check module to determine if it is being used incorrectly.  If so, it will reply with one of two messages:

1. <quoted sentence>

Did you know "everyday" is an adjective meaning typical? The sentence makes no sense grammatically. In the future try to remember that when you mean "each day" you should write "every day" as two separate words.

2. *every day, not everyday

Everyday is an adjective that means typical.
